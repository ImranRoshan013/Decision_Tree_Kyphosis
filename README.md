# Decision_Tree_Kyphosis
this project involved loading, exploring, visualizing, splitting, building, training, and evaluating Decision Tree
and Random Forest models for predicting the occurrence of Kyphosis. 
The classification reports and confusion matrices provided insights into the models' accuracy and performance in classifying 
the medical condition based on patient features.


This project showcases the application of machine learning algorithms to medical data and
demonstrates how Decision Trees and Random Forests can be used for classification tasks. 
Further improvements could involve hyperparameter tuning and exploring other classification algorithms for comparison.
